DaVinci
=======

DaVinci is an opensource project which targets on designing a light weighted information visualization framework for visualization component and application developments. When compared with some other projects such as Prefuse, Peony and The InfoVis Toolkit, this project focused on providing the simplest interfaces and architectures that facilitate efficent agile devlopment. This project is initially designed for my personal usage of the Ph.D study at HKUST. Currently, the project is released under the MIT open source license. Some of the packages and files are ported from other projects such as Prefuse. Please follow their licenses if you want to use these packages.
